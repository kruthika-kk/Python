# Python Notes and Mini Projects 

## Python Notes
This repository contains my day-to-day notes on Python, including basic knowledge in Python programming and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It serves as a reference for Python syntax, common data structures, and algorithms implementation.

### Topics Covered
- Python basics: variables, data types, loops, conditionals
- Functions and modules
- Data Structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- Algorithms: sorting, searching, recursion

### Usage
Feel free to explore and use these notes as a guide for learning Python or refreshing your knowledge.

## Restaurant Example
In this repository, you'll find a basic Python script that simulates taking an order from a customer in a restaurant. It demonstrates the use of dictionaries, loops, and basic input handling.

### Menu Dictionary
The script defines a menu using a Python dictionary:

```python
menu = {
    'Pasta': 50,
    'Avocado Toast': 40,
    'Cold Coffee': 35,
    'Pizza': 25,
    'Summer Salad': 45
}
