Restaurant Order System

This Python script simulates a basic restaurant order system where customers can select items from a predefined menu and see their total bill.

Features:

        Menu Display: Shows the list of available items on the menu along with their prices.
        Item Selection: Allows customers to choose items they want to order.
        Order Total: Calculates and displays the total amount to be paid based on selected items.
        
How to Use:

Menu Display

  When you run the script, it welcomes you and displays the restaurant's menu.
  
Order Placement:

    Enter the name of the item you want to order.
    If the item is on the menu, it adds the item's price to your order total.
    If the item is not available, it notifies you and does not add it to the order.
    
Adding More Items:

      After adding the first item, you can choose to add more items to your order.
      Type Yes to add another item or No to finish your order.
      Total Amount

Once you finish adding items, the script calculates and displays the total amount you need to pay.
